# Loan Status Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the loan status of applicants using predictive modelling techniques. By analyzing various features such as credit score, income, and employment status, we can determine the likelihood of loan approval. This predictive model can help financial institutions streamline their loan approval process.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Google Collab (for interactive development)

## Dataset

- Loan ID
- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self Employed
- Applicant Income
- Co-Applicant Income
- Loan amount
